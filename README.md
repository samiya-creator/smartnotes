# Smart Notes
Smart Notes is a Django application that I've built while learning Django. This project is a simple yet effective tool for note-taking, allowing users to organize their thoughts seamlessly. Whether you're a beginner in Django or an experienced developer looking for a practical example, Smart Notes is a great project to explore and contribute to.

## Features
**User-Friendly Interface:** The application provides a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to create, edit, and organize their notes.

**CRUD Operations:** Smart Notes supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for notes. Users can create new notes, view existing ones, update content, and delete notes when needed.

**Tagging System:** Organize your notes efficiently with a tagging system. Add tags to categorize and filter your notes for a more structured experience.

**Authentication:** Users can register accounts, log in, and log out. This ensures that each user has a personalized space for managing their notes.
